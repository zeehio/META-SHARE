<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#id4">Executive Summary</a><a class="headerlink" href="#executive-summary" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>This document is a guide for those who are interested in providing
Language Resources (LRs) with META-SHARE. It also explains user and
access rights management of the META-SHARE web editor.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="user-and-access-rights-management">
<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#id5">User and Access Rights Management</a><a class="headerlink" href="#user-and-access-rights-management" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Version 3.0 of the META-SHARE web application introduced a fine-grained
user and access rights management system which determines who may do
what on a META-SHARE node. For example, LR providers have more rights
than a normal user who just wants to download LRs, some non-provider
users may be members of an organization which grants special download
rights, etc.</p>
<p>This section describes the META-SHARE user and access rights management
system.</p>
<div class="section" id="basic-user-roles-and-permissions">
<h3><a class="toc-backref" href="#id6">Basic User Roles and Permissions</a><a class="headerlink" href="#basic-user-roles-and-permissions" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>META-SHARE knows the following user roles:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><strong>anonymous user</strong>: used for non-logged in users; no user account;
may browse published LR descriptions and can download free LRs; can
see node statistics.</li>
<li><strong>registered user</strong>: personalized user account tied to an e-mail address;
in addition to the rights of an anonymous user, a registered user may
also contact LR maintainers for obtaining LRs which are not freely
downloadable; can apply for editor group membership and for
organization membership.</li>
<li><strong>editor member</strong>: a registered user who is a member of one or more
editor groups; may create his/her own LR descriptions and may upload
smaller data files for them; may alter LR entries belonging to
his/her editor group; may add owned resources to the editor groups
(s)he is member of.</li>
<li><strong>editor group manager</strong>: a registered user who manages a certain editor
group; may accept or turn down applications for the managed editor
group; may ingest, publish, unpublish and delete LRs belonging
to the managed editor group.</li>
<li><em>organization member</em>: a registered user who is member of an internally
known organization; get the rights of the organization.</li>
<li><strong>organization manager</strong>: a registered user who manages an
internally known
organization; may add and remove registered users to/from the managed
organization group.</li>
<li><strong>superuser</strong>: a registered user who implicitly has all possible
permissions of the META-SHARE web application; a superuser account is
usually created during the installation of a node; superusers are
especially needed for creating editor groups, for making registered users
editor managers, for creating organizations and for making registered
users organization managers.</li>
<li><strong>node administrator</strong>: the person who administers the META-SHARE node
installation; not a META-SHARE web application role but the administrator
should have a superuser account; apart from the node installation, a node
administrator may be needed for uploading larger LR data sets.</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition, there are the following permissions which can be granted to
a group or to individual user accounts:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><strong>META-SHARE associate member</strong>: this permission currently has no effect
in the META-SHARE web application, however, it is expected to have
in the future.</li>
<li><strong>META-SHARE full member</strong>: this permission grants the right to freely
download LRs with a META-SHARE Commons license.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Note</em>: there are further permissions and a few more user roles in the
META-SHARE software. For example, one or more sync user accounts are
required for the node synchronization to work. These additional permissions
and roles are considered to be internal, though: resource providers will
not need to care about them and node administrators need only care where
these roles and permissions are explicitly mentioned in the META-SHARE
manuals.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="resource-ownership-and-access">
<h3><a class="toc-backref" href="#id7">Resource Ownership and Access</a><a class="headerlink" href="#resource-ownership-and-access" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>META-SHARE is all about LRs. Consequently, the META-SHARE <a class="reference internal" href="#basic-user-roles-and-permissions">Basic User Roles and Permissions</a> are centered
around creating, modifying, accessing and otherwise managing these LRs.</p>
<div class="section" id="resource-owners">
<h4><a class="toc-backref" href="#id8">Resource Owners</a><a class="headerlink" href="#resource-owners" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>A LR has zero or more owners, i.e., users who own the resource. The user
who creates a LR is usually the first owner of a LR. Owned LRs are listed
when going to “Manage Resources” → “Manage your own resources” in the
web editor. Additional owners can be added on that page, too. Only
superusers can withdraw LR ownership.</p>
<p>Owners may always edit their LRs, no matter if they are in an editor
group of that LR (explained at <a class="reference internal" href="#editor-groups-for-resources">Editor Groups for Resources</a>) or not.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="editor-groups-for-resources">
<h4><a class="toc-backref" href="#id9">Editor Groups for Resources</a><a class="headerlink" href="#editor-groups-for-resources" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>A LR belongs to zero or more editor groups. As can be expected, editors
of these editor groups may edit such LRs. The user who creates a LR
determines what editor groups a LR gets by default (see below).
Additional editor groups can be added on the “My Resources” page of the
web editor (“Manage Resources” → “Manage your own resources”). Only
superusers can remove editor groups from a LR again.</p>
<p>Every user can choose the editor groups that newly created LRs shall get
by default. Only those editor groups can be chosen, of which the user is
a member. The user profile page (“Your Profile” → “Edit your profile”)
shows which editor groups these are (if any). Adding and removing default
editor groups can be achieved via the “Add default editor groups” and
“Remove default editor groups” menu items of the “Your Profile” menu in
the web editor.</p>

<div class="section" id="managing-user-accounts">
<h3><a class="toc-backref" href="#id10">Managing User Accounts</a><a class="headerlink" href="#managing-user-accounts" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>The META-SHARE User Manual explains how web application users can
register for a new user account. This section details how existing
META-SHARE user accounts can be provided with the different roles that
we introduced in <a class="reference internal" href="#basic-user-roles-and-permissions">Basic User Roles and Permissions</a>.</p>
<div class="section" id="managing-editor-users">
<h4><a class="toc-backref" href="#id11">Managing Editor Users</a><a class="headerlink" href="#managing-editor-users" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>

<h5><a class="toc-backref" href="#id12">Creating and Managing Editor Groups</a><a class="headerlink" href="#creating-and-managing-editor-groups" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h5>
<p>In a new META-SHARE installation there are no editor groups in the system
at all. A superuser first has to create them. Whenever a new editor
group is needed, it has to be created by a superuser.</p>
<p>You can ask the META-SHARE node superusers to create new editor
groups by going to <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">&lt;META_SHARE_NODE_URL&gt;/accounts/contact/</span></tt> (e.g.,
<a class="reference external" href="http://metashare.dfki.de/accounts/contact/">http://metashare.dfki.de/accounts/contact/</a>) and sending them a message.</p>
<p>To create or manage editor groups, choose “Editor groups” from the
“Administration” menu of the web editor. Creating new editor groups can
be accomplished with the “Add editor group” button in the top right
corner of the “Select editor group to change” page. You basically only
need to specify a meaningful name (such as “XYZ Corpus editors”) and
then save.</p>
</div>

<p>Every registered user may <strong>apply for membership</strong> in one or more editor
groups, i.e., for being an editor user. Such an application is possible
from the “Your Profile” menu and then choosing the “Apply for editor
group membership”. Editor group managers of the applied-for group and
superusers will be notified of the application.</p>
<p>As an editor group manager (or superuser) you can <strong>accept or turn down
an editor group membership application</strong> by first choosing “Editor group
applications” from the “Administration” menu of the web editor. From
the editor group application list choose the application that you would

which was created during the installation of your META-SHARE node. However,
if you should still want to grant further user accounts superuser
permissions, you can proceed as follows: as a superuser, go to the web editor
and choose “Users” from the “Administration” menu. Click the user whom you
would like to make a superuser. On the “Change user” page in the
“Permissions” section, make sure that “Superuser status” is activated and
“Save”.</p>
<p>With the above procedure, the chosen user account will <em>implicitly</em> be
granted all available permissions. You should never manually assign all
permissions to a user account in order to make it a superuser; while this may
partly give you the desired results, it will certainly not work in general.</p>

<h3><a class="toc-backref" href="#id24">Granting Permissions</a><a class="headerlink" href="#granting-permissions" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Permissions are very fine-grained flags which control what users and groups
may or mustn’t do in the META-SHARE web application. Only superusers can
manage permissions. However, when using the mechanisms described in
<a class="reference internal" href="#managing-user-accounts">Managing User Accounts</a>, you will usually
<em>not</em> need to care about permissions at all – with one exception:
META-SHARE memberships. Aside from META-SHARE memberships
you should usually never change any of the built-in permissions – unless you
really know what you are doing.</p>
<p>At some point you may want to make single users or organizations META-SHARE
members. As noted in
<a class="reference internal" href="#basic-user-roles-and-permissions">Basic User Roles and Permissions</a>,
META-SHARE membership is controlled with
two permissions (“META-SHARE associate member” and “META-SHARE full member”.
To <strong>grant one of these permissions to a single user</strong>, go to the web editor
and choose “Users” from the “Administration” menu. Click the user whom
you would like to give the permission. On the “Change user” page in the
“Permissions” section, make sure that either the “accounts | user profile |
Is a META-SHARE associate member.” permission or the “accounts | user profile |
Is a META-SHARE full member.” permission is selected. Then save.</p>
<p>To <strong>grant one of the permissions to a group of users</strong> (usually to an
organization), go to <a class="reference external" href="http:/">http:/</a>/&lt;YOUR_NODE&gt;/editor/auth/group/ of the web editor
and click the group to which you would like to give the permission. On the
“Change group” page under “Permissions”, make sure that either the “accounts
| user profile | Is a META-SHARE associate member.” permission or the
“accounts | user profile | Is a META-SHARE full member.” permission is
selected. Then save.</p>

<h4><a class="toc-backref" href="#id38">Conversion of Existing LRs</a><a class="headerlink" href="#conversion-of-existing-lrs" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>The conversion of the existing LRs from several different XML schema to
META-NET XML schema has been made with XSL transformations.</p>
<p>The process was the following:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>The first step was to map all the elements of the other XML schema to
the elements of META-NET XML schema, one by one.</li>
<li>Then, an XSL file was created, which contains the structure of META-NET XML
schema, and XSLT lines harvesting the information from the files of the other
XML schema format.</li>
<li>The conversion process was executed for all given files.</li>
</ul>
<p>Example:</p>
<p>Element <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">resource_periodofcoverage</span></tt> from ELRA format has been mapped to
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">timeCoverage</span></tt> element in META-SHARE schema format.</p>
<p><em>Line in ELRA XML file:</em></p>
<div class="highlight-xml"><div class="highlight"><pre><span class="nt">&lt;resource_periodofcoverage&gt;</span>Between 1992 and 1999<span class="nt">&lt;/resource_periodofcoverage&gt;</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p><em>XSL conversion file:</em></p>
<div class="highlight-xml"><div class="highlight"><pre><span class="nt">&lt;xsl:variable</span> <span class="na">name=</span><span class="s">&#39;time&#39;</span> <span class="na">select=</span><span class="s">&#39;preceding-sibling::resource_periodofcoverage&#39;</span><span class="nt">/&gt;</span>
<span class="nt">&lt;xsl:if</span> <span class="na">test=</span><span class="s">&#39;$time!=&quot;&quot;&#39;</span><span class="nt">&gt;</span>
   <span class="nt">&lt;timeCoverageInfo&gt;</span>
      <span class="nt">&lt;timeCoverage&gt;</span>
         <span class="nt">&lt;xsl:value-of</span> <span class="na">select=</span><span class="s">&#39;$time&#39;</span><span class="nt">/&gt;</span>
      <span class="nt">&lt;/timeCoverage&gt;</span>
   <span class="nt">&lt;/timeCoverageInfo&gt;</span>
<span class="nt">&lt;/xsl:if&gt;</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p><em>Lines in final META-SHARE XML file:</em></p>
<div class="highlight-xml"><div class="highlight"><pre><span class="nt">&lt;timeCoverageInfo&gt;</span>
   <span class="nt">&lt;timeCoverage&gt;</span>Between 1992 and 1999<span class="nt">&lt;/timeCoverage&gt;</span>
<span class="nt">&lt;/timeCoverageInfo&gt;</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>In the example above, the element <em>“timeCoverage”</em> is part of the meta-share
XML structure. The content inside the element is added by the line
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">&lt;xsl:value-of</span> <span class="pre">select='$time'/&gt;</span></tt>, where <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">$time</span></tt> is a XSL variable, defined
before, as the (xpath) <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">preceding-sibling</span></tt> with the name
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">resource_periodofcoverage</span></tt>. If the variable is empty, the element does not
appear in the final XSL file.</p>
<p>This is the way to construct, little by little, a META-SHARE compliant XML file.</p>
<p>For the conversion, there are many things that need to be taken into account,
such as mandatory fields, unique fields, repeated fields, elements that have the
enumeration constraint (i.e., that can only contain a value from a set of
acceptable values), etc. Thus, the conversion files may contain far more
complicated transformations than the one displayed before.</p>
<p>Due the complexity of the META-SHARE schema and the significant differentiation
between this and the other formats,  some tools and mechanisms were used to
simplify the conversion process.</p>
<p>In the case of ILSP and PSP resources conversion, the tool Altova-MapForce was
used for the mapping between schemata and the production of the XSL files. Yet,
there were quite a few cases where the automatically produced files had to be
manually edited in order to fully comply with META-SHARE schema.</p>
<p>In the case of ELRA resources conversion, there was a pre-conversion stage, where
the ELRA format files were converted in simple XML flat list files, with the
following format:</p>
<div class="highlight-xml"><div class="highlight"><pre><span class="nt">&lt;resource</span> <span class="na">id=</span><span class="s">&quot;1&quot;</span><span class="nt">&gt;</span>
   <span class="nt">&lt;resource_id&gt;</span>1<span class="nt">&lt;/resource_id&gt;</span>
   <span class="nt">&lt;resource_reference&gt;</span>ELRA-S0148<span class="nt">&lt;/resource_reference&gt;</span>
   …
<span class="nt">&lt;/resource&gt;</span>
<span class="nt">&lt;resource</span> <span class="na">id=</span><span class="s">&quot;2&quot;</span><span class="nt">&gt;</span>
     …
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Files with this format were the input to the XSL file that were converted in
META-SHARE format. The tool Altova-MapForce, facilitated here as well the mapping
process.</p>

fixed to <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">archive.{'zip',</span> <span class="pre">'tar.gz',</span> <span class="pre">'gz',</span> <span class="pre">'tgz',</span> <span class="pre">'tar',</span> <span class="pre">'bzip2'}</span></tt>.</p>
<p>After upload, the <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">archive.ext</span></tt>, where <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">.ext</span></tt> will be the file extension of
the original file, will be placed inside the dedicated <em>storage folder</em> of the
resource: each <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">StorageObject</span></tt> has a local folder attached to it which is used
to store associated downloadable data.</p>

<p>There are two ways of adding downloadable content to an existing
META-SHARE resource:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>Upload via the web interface (for editor users), or</li>
<li>Upload using the command line <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">storage_admin.py</span></tt> script (for node
administrators only)</li>
</ol>
<div class="section" id="upload-via-the-web-interface">
<h5><a class="toc-backref" href="#id41">Upload via the Web Interface</a><a class="headerlink" href="#upload-via-the-web-interface" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h5>
<p>To upload data via the Web Interface, the provider has to go to the
META-SHARE web editor page for <em>an existing resource</em>. It is <em>not</em> possible
to upload files for new LRs. On the top-right of the browser window, there is
a button &#8220;Upload Data&#8221; next to &#8220;Export Resource Description to XML&#8221;.</p>
<img alt="Export to XML button" class="align-center" src="_images/fig10c.png" />
<p>Clicking the &#8220;Upload Data&#8221; button will load an upload page for the current LR.</p>
<div class="align-center figure align-center">
<img alt="Upload data for a LR" src="_images/fig11.png" />
<p class="caption">Figure 11: Upload data for a LR</p>
</div>
<p>The “Path” information is displayed for convenience and allows to
quickly retrieve the file system path of the <cite>StorageObject</cite>&#8216;s
downloadable content.</p>
<p>Both fields are required. In case the provider attempts to upload without
having filled them in, the fields are highlighted in red, with the
message “This field is required”.</p>
<div class="align-center figure align-center">
<img alt="Required fields for the upload" src="_images/fig12.png" />
<p class="caption">Figure 12: Required fields for the upload</p>
</div>
<p><em>Note:</em> It is required to click the “Upload Permission?” check-box to
verify that the editor user accepts liability for the file he intends
to upload. The editor user should only upload an archive to a META-SHARE
resource if he is allowed to do so; if not, it is better to ask the
original owner of the resource to do so.</p>
<p>Once the upload is successful, the file is copied to the
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">StorageObject</span></tt>&#8216;s storage folder as <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">archive.ext</span></tt> (see above).
The user gets redirected to the editor page for the current resource,
i.e., the page where he started the upload process.</p>
<p><em>Limitation:</em> The web interface upload page only allows files smaller than
MAXIMUM_UPLOAD_SIZE = 1 * 1024 * 1024 bytes to be uploaded. This is a robustness
fix which ensures that the web editor page does not crash due to a very large
file being uploaded.
<a class="reference internal" href="#upload-using-the-command-line-storage-admin-py-script">Upload Using the Command Line storage_admin.py Script</a> offers a solution
for uploading larger files.</p>

<h5><a class="toc-backref" href="#id42">Upload Using the Command Line <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">storage_admin.py</span></tt> Script</a><a class="headerlink" href="#upload-using-the-command-line-storage-admin-py-script" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h5>
<p>When you need to add a <em>large file</em> as downloadable content to an existing
resource, the node administrator can use the <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">storage_admin.py</span></tt> script,
which is available within the <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">metashare/</span></tt> folder.</p>
<p>If called without arguments, the script provides an overview on available options:</p>
<div class="highlight-sh"><div class="highlight"><pre>metashare <span class="nv">$ </span>python2.7 storage_admin.py
    usage: storage_admin.py MODE ARGS...

    <span class="nv">MODE</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="o">[</span>purge, checksum, folder, <span class="nb">help</span><span class="o">]</span>
    Use storage_admin.py <span class="nb">help </span>MODE <span class="k">for </span>detailed usage instructions.
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>To add a large file as downloadable content, you simply have to manually copy
it over to the <em>storage folder</em> belonging to the resource. The <em>storage folder
path</em> can be found in the web interface upload view (see
<a class="reference internal" href="#upload-via-the-web-interface">Upload via the Web Interface</a>).</p>
<p>Once having copied a file named <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">archive.ext</span></tt> to the <em>storage folder path</em>, you
have to update the file checksum to “activate” the new downloadable content. This
is the relevant usage of <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">storage_admin.py</span></tt>:</p>
<div class="highlight-sh"><div class="highlight"><pre>metatashare <span class="nv">$ </span>python2.7 storage_admin.py checksum &lt;storage-object-id&gt;
...
Checksum: d41d8cd98f00b204e9800998ecf8427e
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>You obtain the <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">&lt;storage-object-id&gt;</span></tt> from the last bit of the storage
folder path: the ID is a 64-char hexadecimal String, e.g.,
c0b9a36b50ce11e1a4570017f20dda8ac8066602350044549d62c1bdb750883c.</p>
<p>If no file <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">archive.ext</span></tt> can be found within the storage folder for
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">&lt;storage-object-id&gt;</span></tt> the storage_admin.py script will return
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">Checksum:</span> <span class="pre">None</span></tt>.</p>

<p>It is mandatory to follow the naming scheme. The provider has to make sure
that the downloadable data is contained within one archive file. This file
needs to have one of the following, allowed extensions (as defined in

<li><p class="first">Ingest: Within the META-SHARE context, ingesting a LR into the database is a
one-time, irreversible step. It is preceded by a phase of editing an “internal”
LR, visible only to the LR owners and to the members of the editor group of the
LR. Once the decision is taken that the metadata for a particular LR is “ready”
to make the entry more widely visible, the provider “ingests” the LR into the
database. An ingested LR is still visible only in the web editor. Ingested LRs
are synchronized to other META-SHARE nodes.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">Media types: Within the META-SHARE context, the media types of a LR depend on
its resource type. Thus, a Corpus LR can contain one or more of the following
media types: text, audio, video, image, text-numerical and text-ngram. A
Lexical-Conceptual Resource must contain a text media type and can also
contain audio, video and image media types. A Language Description LR must
contain a text media type and can also contain video and image media types. A
Tool/Service does not contain any media types.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">Metadata: All the information that describes a given LR. Within the META-SHARE
context, metadata can describe all different aspects of a LR, varying from
details on the creation of the LR, to content or language or size information.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">Publish: Within the META-SHARE context, publishing a LR means making it
visible to all META-SHARE users, registered and anonymous.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">Resource type: Within the META-SHARE context, the resource type of a LR has to be strictly one of the following:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><ul class="simple">
<li>Corpus</li>
<li>Lexical-Conceptual Resource</li>
<li>Language Description</li>
<li>Tool / Service</li>
</ul>
</div></blockquote>
</li>
<li><p class="first">Unpublish: Within the META-SHARE context, unpublishing a LR means making it visible only to META-SHARE editors.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">XML metadata file: A XML format file that contains metadata on a LR.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">XML Schema (XSD): An XML Schema is a description of a specific XML type of
files. It contains the structure that these XML files should have, along with
all the constraints that should be respected so that the XML files are valid,
such as the uniqueness of elements, the specific values that elements should
contain etc.</p>

Executive Summary
-----------------

This document is a guide for installing META-SHARE V3.1. It is intended
for system administrators setting up META-SHARE nodes. It also contains
a section on how to upgrade an existing META-SHARE V3.0.x installation
to V3.1.

Backing up META-SHARE 
----------------------

META-SHARE stores the information in two places: a database and a storage
directory. Please follow these instructions to back up both things 
before any upgrade, to revert to the previous version in case of problems.

Before backing up, stop the server to prevent database modifications during
the backup process. The server can be stopped using the ``stop-server.sh``
script.

The storage directory is defined in the ``STORAGE_PATH`` variable
in the ``metashare/local_settings.py`` file of your current META-SHARE
installation. Create a backup of that directory.

If you are using a PostgreSQL database, you can use the ``pg_dump`` command
to create a dump of the META-SHARE database. The database name, host
and port are stored in the ``DATABASES`` variable in
``metashare/local_settings.py``.

   ::

        pg_dump metashare_db_name > metashare_database_backup.sql

Make sure the database dump you have created has contents (is not empty)
and no error appears. Check the `PostgreSQL Documentation: SQL Dump 
<http://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.1/static/backup-dump.html>`__ for
further details if needed.

If instead of PostgreSQL you are using the SQLite database,
you can just copy the SQLite file pointed in the ``DATABASES`` variable.
Be aware that the SQLite database is not recommended on production servers.


Upgrading META-SHARE
---------------------

If you have an installation of META-SHARE previous to V3.0 and you would
like to migrate your resource descriptions, uploaded resource data, user
accounts and statistics to a new META-SHARE installation, then you should
first upgrade to V3.0.x using the Installation Manual that comes with
a V3.0.x release. When you have such an installation working (at least as
a development server), you can follow the migration instructions to the
most recent version in the remainder of this chapter.

Before diving into the actual migration, it should be noted that two
META-SHARE installations on the same machine can interfere with each
other if not configured properly. So in case you would like to upgrade
an installation on a single machine, we recommend to shut down the old
installation (including the Solr server) first unless you know what you
are doing.

Here are now the steps you should follow for a successful migration:

1.  Make sure your META-SHARE-3.0.x instance is stopped.

2. If you have not done it already, go through `Backing up META-SHARE`_.

3. Follow the `Installing META-SHARE`_ section on a new directory.    

   **Note:** during the installation you can skip the creation of a
   database and a role for PostgreSQL, as you already have one in your
   current installation.

4. Make sure your META-SHARE instances are stopped (no development server running).

5. Copy ``/path/to/old/MetaShareNode-3.0/metashare/local_settings.py``
   to ``/path/to/MetaShareNode-3.1/metashare/local_settings.py``

6. Edit the ``local_settings.py``. Add a ``SECRET_KEY`` variable and a
   ``ALLOWED_HOSTS`` variable.
   See `Local Settings for META-SHARE Nodes`_ for information on how to generate it.


7. Adapt any customization you had on the old ``start-server.sh``,
   ``stop-server.sh`` scripts into the new script version.

8. Start your new META-SHARE instance using the ``start-server.sh`` script.


Installing META-SHARE
--------------------------

This section explains how to download and install META-SHARE V3.1 and
its dependencies.

Start by downloading META-SHARE from the
`download page <https://github.com/metashare/META-SHARE/downloads>`__.

Extract the downloaded software into a designated META-SHARE
folder, e.g., ``/path/to/local/MetaShareNode/``.

Software Dependencies
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Database Software
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

*Note:* if you just want to run META-SHARE in **development mode**, or
if you are upgrading META-SHARE you can skip the database setup.

We currently use SQLite or PostgreSQL as our database software. SQLite
comes built-in with Python 2.7. Since SQLite has a number of
limitations, including missing transaction management and access
permission management, the preferred database is PostgreSQL. We have
tested ``PostgreSQL 9.0.5``.

On Debian, Ubuntu and derivatives:

Install PostgreSQL with:

    ::

        sudo apt-get update
        sudo apt-get install postgresql postgresql-contrib

Create a user named ``metashare_user`` (choose any name you like)
for META-SHARE:

    ::

        sudo su – postgres
        createuser -W metashare_user 

Create a database ``metashare_db`` (or any other name), owned by the
just created user ``metashare_user`` (or the name you chose above):

    ::

        sudo su – postgres
        createdb --owner=metashare_user metashare_db


Python interpreter
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

*Note:* If you are upgrading from a previous META-SHARE installation
AND python-2.7 was installed during the previous installation in
``/path/to/old/MetaShareNode3.0/`` please make sure to remove
from your ``PATH`` variable ``/path/to/old/MetaShareNode3.0/opt/bin``.
No path modifications are required anymore.

META-SHARE V3.1 requires Python 2.7. Most Linux/Unix distributions come
already with a preinstalled version of Python. You may check the installed
python version with ``python2 --version``.

In case the output is something like "2.7.x", nothing else needs to be done.

If you have a previous python version, python 2.7 will be installed
to ``/path/to/MetaNode/opt`` during the META-SHARE installation. To do so,
you will need to install some dependencies, such as ``libsqlite3-dev``,
``libssl-dev`` and ``zlib1g-dev``. Please note that these packages may
have different names depending on your Linux/Unix distribution.

On an older Ubuntu without Python 2.7 you might also use the following
command to get all required build dependencies:

    ::

        apt-get build-dep python2.6


Python Modules
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

META-SHARE V3.1 does not bundle anymore all the python dependencies.
Instead of doing that, we follow the standard way of working with
python apps, based on `virtualenv <https://virtualenv.pypa.io>`__ and
`pip <https://pip.pypa.io>`__. Virtualenv allows us to create
isolated python environments, preventing conflicts between coexisting
python applications with different dependencies. Pip is
the recommended tool to install python packages.

The ``psycopg2`` python module is used for connecting PostgreSQL to META-SHARE.
In order to build this module, header files for the PostgreSQL library
``libpq5`` have to be installed, as well as the python headers. On Debian, 
Ubuntu and derivatives, this can be achieved installing the ``libpq-dev`` and 
``python-dev`` packages using ``apt-get install libpq-dev python-dev``.

Once this header files are installed, the rest of the dependencies can be
installed simply by:

    ::

        cd "/path/to/local/MetaShareNode/"
        ./install-dependencies.sh

This script will:

1. Check that Python 2.7 is installed, or download and install it to
   ``/path/to/local/MetaShareNode/opt/bin``.
2. Download virtualenv
3. Create a virtual environment at ``/path/to/local/MetaShareNode/venv``.
4. Download, build and install all META-SHARE dependencies using pip in the
   created virtual environment.

If everything is installed successfully the message ``Installation of
META-SHARE dependencies complete.`` should appear in the end.

For your information, the dependencies and their respective versions are
listed in the `requirements.txt` file.

Web Server
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

*Note:* if you just want to run META-SHARE in **development mode**, you
can skip the web server setup.

META-SHARE is a web application that builds on a web server. Deployment
has been tested with ``lighttpd 1.4.33`` via FastCGI. Other web servers
can be used, but you do so on your own risk.

We strongly recommend to set up your web server so that it only serves
SSL encrypted connections. We are shipping a sample configuration for
``lighttpd`` under ``metashare/lighttpd-ssl.conf.sample`` which should
give you an idea on how to set this up.

Development Server
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To verify that you have installed all dependencies correctly, you should
first set up a development server. Proceed as follows.

1. Create ``local_settings.py`` for your local META-SHARE node:

   ::

       cp metashare/local_settings.sample metashare/local_settings.py    

   Edit at least the following constants: ``DJANGO_URL``, ``DJANGO_BASE``,
   ``STORAGE_PATH``, ``DEBUG``, ``SECRET_KEY``, ``ADMINS``, ``DATABASES``, and ``EMAIL_BACKEND``. More
   information is available in `Local Settings for META-SHARE
   Nodes`_

   **Note:** If you are upgrading from a previous META-SHARE version,
   make sure to NOT use your production ``STORAGE_PATH`` or your production
   database in ``local_settings.py`` for testing the installation.

2. Initialize database contents:

   ::

       source venv/bin/activate # enables META-SHARE virtual environment
       python manage.py syncdb
       deactivate  # disables META-SHARE virtual environment

Answer “yes” when asked to create a superuser account and fill in the
requested details.

3. Start an Apache Solr server for the search index (uses Java and
   Python internally):

   ::

       metashare/start-solr.sh

4. Run tests to check that Django can load and serve META-SHARE:

   ::

       source venv/bin/activate
       python manage.py test repository storage accounts sync stats  
       deactivate

   This should return “OK”.

   *Note:* This step may take a few minutes.

5. Run a Django development server:

   ::

       source venv/bin/activate
       python manage.py runserver    
         Validating models...    
         0 errors found  
         Django version 1.4.x, using settings 'metashare.settings'   
         Development server is running at http://127.0.0.1:8000/ 
         Quit the server with CONTROL-C.
       deactivate

Congratulations: you have successfully started a META-SHARE V3.1 node in
development mode. This means that all required Python and Django
dependencies are functioning correctly.

Local Settings for META-SHARE Nodes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Note:** If you are upgrading a META-SHARE installation, you can now
follow the rest of the `Upgrading META-SHARE`_ instructions as the
``local_settings.py`` file will be copied from the previous META-SHARE
installation.

Django projects usually store all their configuration settings in a file
named settings.py. For META-SHARE, we have split up the set of
configuration parameters into two groups: local and global settings. You
should never have to change the *global* settings in ``settings.py`` as
they are neither security-critical nor node-dependant. You can and
partially have to change local configuration settings, though, which are
stored in their own file named ``local_settings.py``.

The META-SHARE software package only contains a file named
``local_settings.sample`` that lists and explains all local settings
available for META-SHARE nodes. You have to create a node-local copy of
this sample file with the name ``local_settings.py`` and adapt some
configuration settings.

The local settings are the following:

-  ``DJANGO_URL = 'http://www.example.com/path/to/metashare'``

   The URL for this META-SHARE node as it is reachable from the
   internet; it is important to emphasize that this must not be any
   internal URL which is only reachable behind some proxy server! Do not
   use a trailing slash (/)!You can use ``http://127.0.0.1:8000`` when
   running a development mode server.

-  ``DJANGO_BASE = 'path/to/metashare/'``

   The base path under which Django is deployed at ``DJANGO_URL``. Use a
   trailing slash(/). Do not use a leading slash, though. Leave empty if
   META-SHARE is deployed directly under the given ``DJANGO_URL``.

-  ``FORCE_SCRIPT_NAME = ""``

   This is required when the META-SHARE node is deployed using FastCGI
   and for example lighttpd. There is a known bug with FCGI hosted
   applications and lighttpd; it basically messes up the URL after HTTP
   submits. ``FORCE_SCRIPT_NAME= ""`` fixes the issue and hence is
   required for lighttpd use.

-  ``ALLOWED_HOSTS = [ 'www.example.com' ]

   A list of strings representing the host/domain names this META-SHARE
   instance can be served at.

-  ``STORAGE_PATH = '/path/to/storage/path'``

   Absolute path to the local storage base, i.e., the folder in which
   your language resource data is stored. You need to supply an existing
   path here, even for development mode! This folder will contain data
   related to your language resources, so choose a suitable location
   that is accessible, safe and that has sufficient free space for all
   resource data that you would like to upload.

-  ``DEBUG``, ``TEMPLATE_DEBUG``, ``DEBUG_JS``

   Debug settings: setting ``DEBUG=True`` will give exception
   stacktraces on the website, for example. This may include sensitive
   information, so use with care, preferably only for local development
   servers.

-  ``SECRET_KEY``

   Set this variable to a random value. This is used by django to salt the
   passwords stored in the database and generate tokens.
   See `SECRET_KEY django documentation <https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/ref/settings/#secret-key>`__
   for further information.
   The following python code can help you to generate a random string:

       ::

           # From: https://gist.github.com/mattseymour/9205591
           import string, random
           chars = ''.join([string.ascii_letters, string.digits, string.punctuation]).replace('\'', '').replace('"', '').replace('\\', '')
           print ''.join([random.SystemRandom().choice(chars) for i in range(50)]) 


-  ``ADMINS``

   Configure the administrators for this Django project. If
   ``DEBUG=False``, all errors will be reported as e-mails to these
   persons. If you do not set any administrators here, you will

   (a) not get any notifications of problems with the META-SHARE site;
       and (b) not be able to get useful feedback from the META-SHARE
       technical helpdesk if you should run into internal server errors
       500).

-  ``DATABASES``

   Configures the database settings for Django. For SQLite, use the
   following settings:

   ::

       DATABASES = {   
            'default': {   
                'ENGINE': 'django.db.backends.sqlite3',    
               'NAME': '{0}/testing.db'.format(ROOT_PATH)  
            }  
       }

   For PostgreSQL, the following settings are required:

   ::

       DATABASES = {   
            'default': {   
                'ENGINE': 'django.db.backends.postgresql_psycopg2',    
                'NAME': 'metashare',   
                'USER': 'db_user', 
                'PASSWORD': 'db_password', 
                'HOST': 'localhost',   
                # Set to empty string for default. 
                'PORT': '',    
                # This is required to make import more robust. 
                'OPTIONS': {   
                  'autocommit': True,  
                }  
            }  
       }

-  ``EMAIL_BACKEND = 'django.core.mail.backends.smtp.EmailBackend'``

   Settings for sending mail. Production servers should use the SMTP
   e-mail backend as indicated in the ``local_settings.sample`` file.

-  ``TIME_ZONE = 'Europe/Berlin'``

   Local time zone for this installation.

-  ``SYNC_USERS = {'sync-user-1': 'some_password', }``

   Credentials (user name and password) for one or more user accounts
   with the permission to access synchronization information on the
   configured META-SHARE Node. If you are no META-SHARE Managing Node,
   then you will only need at most sync user account here. Such an
   account is required for linking your node to the META-SHARE Network –
   see `Linking your Node with the META-SHARE Network`_. Essentially a
   sync user account is a normal user account and therefore it also
   lives in the same namespace. Thus, a sync user account must have a
   different name from any existing user accounts! You always have to
   run ``manage.py syncdb``, whenever you change the ``SYNC_USERS``
   setting.

See also `Search Engine Optimization and Web Analytics`_ for further
settings that can be used in the context of web analytics.

*Note:* settings changes will only take effect when the Django server is
restarted!

Deployment Server
-----------------

For deployment, we assume that you have downloaded and installed the
lighttpd web server (see also `I Want to use MySQL and/or Apache`_) and a
``PostgreSQL database``. You have to adapt ``start_server.sh`` and
``stop_server.sh`` with correct IP addresses and port numbers. The IP
addresses should be identical to the one you added to your
``lighttpd.conf``, the port number, of course, needs to be different
from the web server’s.

You can test your PostgreSQL database by calling ``manage.py syncdb``;
this will complain if it cannot properly access the database.

Once both the web server and the database are ready, use
``start_server.sh`` to start the threaded production server via FastCGI;
don’t forget to set ``DEBUG=False``! ``stop_server.sh`` of course stops
the FastCGI server and the corresponding lighttpd process.

*Note:* the ``start_server.sh`` script automatically installs some
cronjobs which are required for the automatic synchronization of linked
nodes, for periodic database cleanups, etc. The ``stop_server.sh``
script automatically uninstalls these cron jobs again.

Solr Server for Browsing and Searching
--------------------------------------

The META-SHARE release comes with a pre-configured Solr server used to
index the META-SHARE database for browsing and searching.

To start the preconfigured Solr server, go to the ``metashare`` folder
and run:

::

    ./start-solr.sh

To stop a running Solr server, go to the metashare folder and run:

::

    ./stop-solr.sh

These commands must be run by hand for the development server; they are
included in the start-server.sh and stop-server.sh scripts used for the
deployment server.

This should be all you need for usual operation. The following
subsections are required only for people who want to understand in depth
how to operate and configure the Solr server.

Installing Solr
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1. Make sure you have Java 1.6 or later (run ``java -version`` to check!).
2. Download the latest version of Solr from here.
3. Unzip into a folder, henceforth called ``$SOLR_DIR``.
4. Go to ``misc/solr-config-sample`` in your local META-SHARE-Software
   repository and run:

   ::

       ./create_solr_config.sh "$SOLR_DIR" 

   This will configure your Solr server with a sample configuration. It
   will overwrite the default Solr configuration. After this step you
   will have a Solrserver which is configured with two cores (→ indexes)
   main and testing.

5. Change directory to $SOLR\_DIR/example.
6. Run

   ::

       java -jar start.jar

7. Open a web browser and go to
   ``http://localhost:8983/solr/main/admin/``. You should be able to see
   Solr’s admin interface for the main core.

   For further help go to the Solr Tutorial page.

Keeping the Solr Configuration Up-to-Date
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

As development on the search functionality continues, you may have to
occasionally recreate your Solr configuration. Before doing that you
have to shut down your Solr server (``Ctrl+C``). Now you can either:

-  Follow the steps in the previous section. This will erase all your
   index data. After that, run ``python manage.py rebuild_index`` to
   rebuild your index from the current database content.

-  Or you manually update the Solr configuration by going through the
   following steps.

Manually Updating the Solr Configuration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1. Create Solr schema files automatically by running:

   ::

       source venv/bin/activate
       python manage.py build_solr_schema
       deactivate

   The XML output of this command should go into both
   ``$SOLR_DIR/example/solr/main/conf/schema.xml`` and
   ``$SOLR_DIR/example/solr/testing/conf/schema.xml``.

2. If there should be any changes in the files in
   ``misc/solr-config-sample``, then copy these files to both
   ``$SOLR_DIR/example/solr/main/conf`` and
   ``$SOLR_DIR/example/solr/testing/conf``.

3. Restart the Solr server.

4. If you already have any data in your database, then manually build
   the search index once. Run:

   ::

       source venv/bin/activate
       python manage.py rebuild_index
       deactivate

   Any future changes and additions to your database should
   automatically be reflected in the search index. A manual rebuild
   should not be required anymore (except when working on the indexing
   itself).

Linking your Node with the META-SHARE Network
---------------------------------------------

Overview
~~~~~~~~

META-SHARE aims to provide an infrastructure that makes language
resources available in a network of many META-SHARE Nodes, the
META-SHARE Network. A number of nodes with certain technical and
organizational characteristics undertake the role of META-SHARE Managing
Nodes. Such nodes harvest and store metadata records from the META-SHARE
Nodes of the entire META-SHARE Network. META-SHARE Managing Nodes share
metadata, create, host and maintain a central inventory which includes
metadata-based descriptions of all language resources available in the
distributed network. Each META-SHARE Managing Node effectively hosts a
copy of the central inventory.

To actually link your META-SHARE Node installation with the META-SHARE
Network, your node has to be proxied by a META-SHARE Managing Node.
In `Step-by-Step Instructions`_ are detailed the steps that are
required for this.

Step-by-Step Instructions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

These are the steps which are required for linking your META-SHARE node
with the META-SHARE Network:

-  In your ``local_settings.py`` file (see `Local Settings for META-SHARE Nodes`_), make sure to
   have an entry in the ``SYNC_USERS`` dictionary. Remember to run the
   following command, whenever you change the ``SYNC_USERS`` setting:

       ::

            source venv/bin/activate
            python ./manage.py syncdb
            deactivate

-  Give the account credentials of your ``SYNC_USERS`` entry and your
   public node URL (e.g., ``http://you.example.org/metashare``) to the
   system administrator of the META-SHARE Managing Node which shall
   proxy your META-SHARE node.

-  Contact either the administrator at CNR, DFKI, ELDA, FBK or ILSP
   (current META-SHARE Managing Node providers); never go to more
   than one of these META-SHARE Managing Nodes. You can use the
   contact form at ``<MANAGING_NODE_URL>/accounts/contact/`` – for
   example, http://metashare.dfki.de/accounts/contact/.

-  The system administrator of the chosen META-SHARE Managing Node
   will set up her node as a proxy for your resource descriptions.

-  If all went as expected, then the chosen META-SHARE Managing Node
   will automatically synchronize with your node and people will be able
   to see (not edit!) your resource metadata on all META-SHARE Managing
   Nodes of the META-SHARE Network.

Importing and Exporting Resources
---------------------------------

Metadata descriptions of language resources can be imported into the
META-SHARE software from XML files obeying the META-SHARE schema format.
Likewise, the metadata descriptions in the META-SHARE database can be
exported into XML files in the format defined by the META-SHARE XML
schema.

Importing XML Files into META-SHARE
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

There are two possibilities of importing language resource XML
descriptions which are outlined in the following sections.

In general, all files to import should be schema-valid according to the
current META-SHARE XML schema file which is located in
``misc/schema/v3.0/META-SHARE-Resource.xsd``. Please use an XML schema
validator to verify that the import files are valid before trying to
import them into META-SHARE. For example, you can use ``xmllint`` like
so:

::

    xmllint --schema META-SHARE-Resource.xsd data.xml

Schema validity is not strictly required by the importer; reasonable
efforts are made to import partial or erroneous XML files. However, in
order to avoid loosing data, please try to make your files schema valid.

Importing from the Command Line
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

META-SHARE comes with a tool called ``import_xml.py`` to import XML
files describing language resources into the system. To import, run
``import_xml.py`` as follows:

::

    source venv/bin/activate
    cd metashare
    python import_xml.py <file.xml|archive.zip> [<file.xml|archive.zip> …]
    deactivate

In other words, you can provide one or more individual XML files or zip
files containing XML files. The script will print a summary count of
successfully imported and erroneous files at the end.

Importing from the Editor
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

An alternative way of importing resources is provided by the “Upload”
menu item of the editor. There you can also provide individual XML files
or zip files containing XML files. Compared to the shell importer, the
upload size is limited, though.

Exporting XML Files from META-SHARE
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

META-SHARE aims to be an open platform and therefore allows for the
export of resources in the original XML format. As with the import,
there are two possible ways for exporting, both of which are described
in the following sections.

Exporting from the Command Line
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The script ``export_xml.py`` will export all entries from the database
into a zip archive containing one XML file per resource. The script
requires a valid META-SHARE V3.1 database. It can be run as follows:

::

    source venv/bin/activate
    cd metashare
    python export_xml.py <archive.zip>
    deactivate

The resulting archive is suitable for import in any META-SHARE V2.1 (or
later) installation.

Exporting from the Editor
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

As an alternative to the shell exporter you may export resource
descriptions from the editor.

-  A single resource XML description can be exported from the main
   editor page of the resource using the “Export Resource Description to
   XML” button at the top of the page.

-  A bundle of freely selectable resources may be exported as a zip
   archive from the “Editable Resources” page using the “Action” menu.
   The resulting archive is suitable for import in any META-SHARE V2.1
   or later installation.

Copying Data between META-SHARE Nodes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Since V3.0, META-SHARE supports the automatic synchronization of
metadata between a configurable set of META-SHARE nodes. You should
usually not manually copy resource descriptions by exporting and
importing. An exception might be the case where you would like to create
a brand new resource description which is very similar to an existing
resource description.

Setting up Editor User Accounts
-------------------------------

For information on how to set up and manage user accounts, please see
the META-SHARE Provider Manual.

Search Engine Optimization and Web Analytics
--------------------------------------------

META-SHARE integrates the most common techniques for Search Engine
Optimization (SEO). In order to check whether SEO works as it should,
META-SHARE also integrates “django-analytical”, a package for easily
integrating analytics services like Google Analytics or Clicky. If you
would like to use an analytics service, then just add the corresponding
configuration to your ``local_settings.py`` file. Valid configuration
options for the supported analytics services can be found
`here <http://packages.python.org/django-analytical/install.html#enabling-the-services>`__.

*Note:* since META-SHARE V3.0.1 we ship with a common Google Analytics
tracking code for all META-SHARE websites. The tracking code is
activated by default in ``metashare/templates/base.html``. If you
wouldn’t like your META-SHARE installation to be tracked, you can remove
the Google Analytics JavaScript snippet from this template. You also
have to remove the snippet if you would like to use your own Google
Analytics tracking code via django-analytical!

Frequently Asked Questions
--------------------------

This section compiles a number of the most frequently asked questions.

I Want to use MySQL and/or Apache
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

It may be possible to get these to work, but we have not tested these
configurations and therefore cannot provide any support for them. The
recommended database and web server technologies are listed in `Software Dependencies`_.

I Need Help Configuring lighttpd
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The release includes a sample lighttpd.conf configuration file under
``metashare/lighttpd-ssl.conf.sample`` (or
``metashare/lighttpd-ssl.conf.sample`` for the non-SSL variant) which
you can use as the basis for your configuration. More information on how
to properly setup lighttpd with FastCGI support can be found in the
`Django documentation <https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.4/howto/deployment/fastcgi/>`__.

Also, look at the scripts ``start-server.sh`` and ``stop-server.sh``
which should show you how to start up and shut down the production
server.

I am Getting Storage Errors when Importing or Saving
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

::

    File "/usr/local/MetaShareNode/metashare/../metashare/storage/models.py",=  line 254, in save
    mkdir(self._storage_folder()) OSError: [Errno 2] No such file or directory:
    '/home/storage/b557040eff1d11= e09075080027fee6a9b7ffe41433e94b19844c6038a825a145'
    File "/usr/local/MetaShareNode/metashare/../metashare/storage/models.py",= line 254, in save 
    mkdir(self._storage_folder())  OSError: [Errno 2] No such file or directory:
    '/home/storage/b557040eff1d11=e09075080027fee6a9b7ffe41433e94b19844c6038a825a145'

The first thing to verify is whether the ``STORAGE_PATH`` setting in
``local_settings.py`` points to a valid and existing folder – see
`Local Settings for META-SHARE Nodes`_ for details.

Why Can Django not Serve the Static Files?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

While in principle, Django could also serve those static files, this is
not recommended for production use – it makes a lot more sense to have a
dedicated, lightweight web server handle that task. Some more
information on combining Django and lighttpd is available
`here <https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.3/howto/deployment/fastcgi/#lighttpd-setup>`__

PostgreSQL Error Message
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

::

    --- File "/usr/lib/python2.7/site-packages/django/db/backends/postgresql_psycopg2/base.py", line 24, in <module>
    raiseImproperlyConfigured("Error loading psycopg2 module: %s" % e) django.core.exceptions.ImproperlyConfigured:
    Error loading psycopg2 module: No module named psycopg2 ---

Seems like you are trying to use PostgreSQL but you have not installed
the ``psycopg2`` dependency. See `Python Modules`_ for how to install it.

Problems with Importing XML Files
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

We are trying to use ``import_xml.py`` to import XML files into the
database. We are using an XML file that validates against the schema,
but we get the following  error:

::

    source venv/bin/activate
    python import_xml.py  ApertiumLMFBasqueDictionary.xml
    deactivate

    Importing XML file: "ApertiumLMFBasqueDictionary.xml"
    Could not import XML file into database!

If you encounter this error, please first check that the XML file is
indeed schema-valid with respect to the latest schema files. If so,
there might be a bug – please send us the example file if possible so
that we can reproduce and fix it: helpdesk-technical@meta-share.eu

Updating the GeoIP Database for Statistics Collection
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The country-based statistics do not seem to properly work anymore.

For statistical purposes, META-SHARE collects information about the
country of origin of web site visitors. In this process, the IP address
of the visiting user is converted to the country using the GeoLite
Country database. As IP address to country mappings may change over
time, an automatically set up cron job updates the used database every
month for better statistics results.

The current version of the database is downloaded into the directory
``/path/to/local/MetaShareNode/metashare/stats/resources/`` using the
following resource file (which is configurable in ``settings.py`` via
the ``GEOIP_DATA_URL`` key):
http://geolite.maxmind.com/download/geoip/database/GeoLiteCountry/GeoIP.dat.gz

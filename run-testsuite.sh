# IMPORTANT: This script creates a new firefox profile in which the popup
# blocker is disabled.
# This profile is not removed automatically (FIXME) because firefox does not
# offer a command line to remove profiles (as far as I know)
# This means that if you run this on your own computer you will need to
# remove the firefox profile "firefox_profile" by yourself.
# How to remove a Firefox profile?
# You only need to close firefox and open it. A dialog
# will appear for you to choose the profile you want, with an option
# to delete any profile you have. Please delete the "firefox_profile".
# Your settings are usually saved in the "default" profile, so do not remove
# that profile.
